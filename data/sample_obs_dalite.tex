\midrule
 The graph shows constant positive acceleration and then constant negative acceleration. This means that the velocity-time graph should have a positive slope and then a negative slope, and graph C is the only option that satisfies those requirements. &  1st, acceleration is +, indicating an increase in velocity.\textbackslash r\textbackslash nthen, acceleration is suddenly and without warning negative, and velocity is reduced. \\
