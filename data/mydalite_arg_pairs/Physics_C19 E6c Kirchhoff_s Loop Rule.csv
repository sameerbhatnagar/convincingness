56,"Since the path flows from - to positive across the batteries, the voltage is positive, and since the current flows in the opposite direction of the path, the resistance has to be negative. By V = IR, the current must then also be negative.","Gain 80 V across first battery, lose I1*(1 ohm) V across BC resistor, lose I1*(20 ohm) V across resistor before D, gain 45 V across DE battery, lose I2*(1 ohm) V across EF resistor, lose I2*(40 ohm) V across FA resistor.
