\textit{ Law should always to make for the good of their people.If wearing 
helmet help,then it should be enforce.Also,you cannot assure that every 
motorcycle in the country would want to  pay. } &  I believe that motorcycle 
helmets should be mandatory for ALL motorcycle drivers . Although they may be 
willing to pay their own medical bills , you ca n't pay anything if you 're not 
alive to do so . Motorcycle wrecks can kill the driver , leaving the drivers 
family with funeral expenses and the like . The family may not be able to 
afford it . Wearing a helmet increases possibility of surviving a crash that 
you may not otherwise survive . So yes , motorcycle helmets should be mandatory 
even if the rider is willing to pay their own medical expenses .. \\
