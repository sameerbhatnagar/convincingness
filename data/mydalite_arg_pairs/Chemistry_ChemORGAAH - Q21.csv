66,"the formation of a first order cabocation is impossible because it is very unstable hence it wont happen via sn1.
to form such an unstable molecule lots of energy is required. so the activation energy is high and it won't happen.","The SN1 mechanism needs stable carbocation intermediates to react, so since the methyl and primary alcohols have too high of an energy requirement, they do not react via the SN1 mechanism",a2,arg199146,arg33205,arg199146_arg33205,rr,0a31399c8ffa482f303047e0010ef0,1
