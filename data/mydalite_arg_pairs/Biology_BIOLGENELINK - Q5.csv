56,"The distance between the gene for the disease and the blood type are close to each other so the genes are linked and on the same chromosome. There are more chances of getting the parental phenotype. If this was based on independent assortment, the chances would be 25% but in this case it is higher.","The parental genotypes are NA/ nO and nO/ nO. considering that the recombinant frequency is 12%, then 50% of 88% will be parental type and 1/2 of that will. be n O/ n O therefore, it is 44%.",a2,arg240116,arg208281,arg240116_arg208281,ww,ca97ba7f611f7dd6186d9a713558a8,1
