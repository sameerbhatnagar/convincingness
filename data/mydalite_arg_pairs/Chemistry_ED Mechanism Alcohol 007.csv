55,"This is supposed to be a  substitution reaction , thus there should not be a formation of alkene at the end of the mechanism . To have an alkene,the mechanism should be this of an elimination with the nu adding on the H of ch2 then the arrow goes to the adjacent C and the leaving group.However, the leaving group should be the halogen.","Rearrangement of the carbocation is not required as the carbocation formed following the falling off of the OH2+ is already tertiary and is the most stable form.

56,"Hey Andy, everything you did was fine until step IV and V. Considering that Bromine is a weak base but reasonable nucleophile, and that no heating is present during the reaction, a SN1 reaction would be favored instead of an elimination reaction. Thus, a carbocation intermediate would form and the Br would attack it. You will end up with a different final product.","The bromide indicated to deprotonate the molecule in step IV is not a strong enough base to do that. Step V is also wrong because the carbon that the leaving group was attached to became a tertiary carbocation, which is relatively stable, and not unstable enough to force a double bond to form. The reaction that would occur instead is a bromide ion would attack the carbocation.",a2,arg56481,arg48915,arg56481_arg48915,rr,c82cfadb3a76635f1a571405513071,1
57,"Since leaving group is attached to a tertiary carbon, it can either be Sn1 or e1.
