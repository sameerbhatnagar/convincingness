56,Based on Kirchoff's law the equal sum of magnitude of the currents into a junction equal the sum of magnitude of currents directed out of the junction,"The junction rule states that the sum of the currents at a junction must equal zero.

57,"The junction rule states that the sum of the currents at a junction must equal zero. Therefore, the current flowing into a junction should cancel out the current flowing out of the junction. The two values are thus equal. ",There are some current cancels out. so the sum will be less than the total,a1,arg41736,arg237511,arg41736_arg237511,wr,07827df0e520fdcc555ce3f6240718,-1
