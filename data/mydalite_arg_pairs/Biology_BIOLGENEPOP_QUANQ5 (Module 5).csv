78,"Self-fertilization is the most severe form of inbreeding. Assume you are starting with a population with an allele frequency of A = p = 0.6 and the allele frequency of a = q = 0.4, and that the population is in Hardy-Weinberg proportions for the diploid genotypes at this locus. What proportion of heterozygotes do you expect to see in the next generation?","First we calculate the frequency of the recessive allele (q). (2000 + 200)/10000 = .22
Then we calculate the frequency of the dominant allele (p) 1-.22 = .88
Then we calculate the frequency of the heterozygous population: 2*(.88)*(.22) = .3872
Then we add half the heterozygous frequency to the entire homozygous population
